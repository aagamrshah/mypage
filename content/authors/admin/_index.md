I am a PhD candidate in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://matse.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu/), where I conduct research as part of the [Tawfick group](https://tawfick.mechse.illinois.edu/) and the [Ertekin group](https://oasis.mechse.illinois.edu/) under the [nanoMFG node](http://nanomfgnode.illinois.edu/). My work focusses on using Bayesian statistics to develop active-learning predictive models for graphene synthesis by chemical vapour deposition, and for powder bed fusion processes. I also use and develop supervised and unsupervised techniques to analyse electron and optical microscopy images. I love to tinker around with additive manufacturing techniques, exploring the use of fascinating structures in everyday life. My other interests include swimming, squash, and hiking.
