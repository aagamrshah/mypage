summary:
abstract: In this talk, we will present work to make accessible large-scale (and small-scale) simulations through the usage of web technologies, APIs, access to python libraries, Jupyter, and webassembly. Weâ€™ll describe our utilization of tools such as yt as well as implementations of tools on top of this, such as widgyts and ytree.
