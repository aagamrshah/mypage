### September 2019 - _present_
- Synthesised graphene using chemical vapour deposition. Varied specific reaction parameters - such as total gas flow rate and growth duration - using design of experiments and achieved high repeatability in the quality of graphene.
- Performed active learning using Bayesian optimisation to exploit the experimental results and facilitate more efficient discovery of complex synthesis recipes.
- Published software on nanoHUB to enable crowd-sourcing of synthesis recipes and analysis of microscopy images and Raman spectra, with more than 750 total users worldwide.
- Automated segmentation of scanning electron microscopy images of graphene with a deep neural network with 94.5% pixel-wise accuracy using only 93 training images. Published the trained model, compatible with deepImageJ, at [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7063245](doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7063245).
